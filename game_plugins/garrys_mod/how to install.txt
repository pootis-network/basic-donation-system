Welcome and thank you for using Basic Donation System!
This tutorial will show you how to setup the Garry's Mod plugin.

First, ensure your hosting provider supports the mySQLoo module (most of them support mySQLoo as of 2021)
then, once you install mySQLoo on the server, install the addon and configure the following:

Head to donation-system\lua\autorun\server and edit the settings in donation_system.lua:

anything with DB_ is mySQL related,
DB_HOST is the SQL server to connect to, ensure the server is running in port 3306
DB_USERNAME is the username of the SQL server to login with
DB_PASSWORD is the password of the SQL server to login with

SERVER_ID is the unique id you can assign to the server, it is used to identify the Garry's Mod server.

You can enable or disable the donation chat commands by editing CHAT_CMD_ENABLE to either true or false.
Dont forget to edit CHAT_CMD_URL to your donation page first before enabling the chat commands!


DONT TOUCH ANYTHING BELOW THE CHAT COMMANDS UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!
