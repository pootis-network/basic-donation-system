## Features:
* CoinPayments Support! accept EVERY SINGLE CRYPTOCURRENCY!!


* OpenID login (eliminates user error)
* gForum(smf) group support
* Multiple Paypal account support for either servers or packages individually.
* Ranks (either permanent or timed for any admin mod you have, no third party addon required).
* SourceMod support (you can use with Counter-Strike or Team-Fortress games)
* Global packages (one purchase will apply on multiple servers)

* Most configuration is done in one config file, no need to go through different hosts or files to configure the system.
* Support for other games, even if you have only Garry&#039;s Mod servers, you might want to expand your servers to other games as the community gets bigger.
* Security in mind. (This is not SQL injectable)

----
## Requirements: 
* Web Host with PHP 5.1.2(or greater) installed. Sites like enjin.com won&#039;t work because they don&#039;t support PHP.
* MySQL Server, usually comes with web host.
* Premier/Business Paypal account, its free to upgrade.
* [MySQLOO v8](https://github.com/FredyH/MySQLOO) installed on game server. Some game hosting companies doesn&#039;t allow custom binary modules to be installed on their servers. You should contact your game host to make sure you are allowed to upload binary files before installing this script.
